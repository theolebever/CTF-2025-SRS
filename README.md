> This repository consists of a docker-compose file that will allow you to deploy a whole web architecture for the CTF game of the 2025 SRS promotion at EPITA engineering school.

## Deploy

To instantiate the architecture, you must first clone the repository and then run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up
```

It will take a few minutes to download the images and start the containers. Once that's done two websites will be available:
```
http://vitrine.srs2025.com
http://cms.srs2025.com
```
To set up the CMSmadesimple, simply follow the instructions on the website: https://docs.cmsmadesimple.org/
